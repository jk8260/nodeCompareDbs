# Guaranteed Rate Homework

Homework is a Node.js console app. 
This app was developed on WSL2 but should run on any node platform.

## Assumptions

- both supplied docker images are running and their ports on localhost are 5432 & 5433
- counts will display in the console
- missing, mismatch and added datasets are stored in output/ as json files

## Installation


Use WSL2 command prompt and npm to restore the packages

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Use WSL2 command prompt and node cli to run the app

```bash
node nodeCompareDbs.js
```
if you wish I have also setup an npm script named start
```bash
npm start
```
